Developed a neural network model to classify housing locations based on demographic and housing features from a California housing dataset.
Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical labels with one-hot encoding, and scaling features using StandardScaler for optimal model convergence.
Designed and trained a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers and a softmax output layer, achieving robust classification performance.
Conducted model evaluation using training, validation, and test splits, visualizing loss and accuracy metrics to ensure generalization.
Skills & Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Deep Learning, Data Preprocessing, Visualization (Matplotlib)
Outcome: Achieved an accuracy of 91% on the test set , demonstrating the model's ability to effectively classify housing proximity to the ocean.
